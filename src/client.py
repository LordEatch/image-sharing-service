# NOTE
# You donâ€™t specify a client port because the OS auto-assigns an ephemeral one to bind to the socket (49152-65535).
# The TCP handshake automatically communicates that port to the server.
# The server replies to that port as part of the established connection.
# You can manually bind to a port if you need full control (rare outside specialized networking scenarios).
# Servers need to define a port so that clients can connect to them.

# Create a TCP socket (SOCK_STREAM) that uses IPv4 (AF_INET).

    # Now the client can send and receive data to the server.
