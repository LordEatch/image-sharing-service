- finish server/request_handling.py with proper error handling and error codes back to server. maybe add parameter to message protocol?
- finish storage.py
- make sure there are no crashes for errors (big job)
- make sure there are no semantic errors where i have used 'is' instead of '=='

unimportant:
- check that variable names are consistently short (outside of utilities)
- use george to check if i could improve type checking outside of utilities
- sort the names of all constants (including private ones in functions)
- check that all imports are relative
